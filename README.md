# Evo-Game (*Working Title*)

"Evo-Game" is an open-source, bare-bones, web-based game engine written in TypeScript and supported by an Express server, React front-end, and Postgres database architecture.

### About

The engine is built around concepts geared towards text-based and 2D RPGs with influences from both modern and retro game design. While the intention is for this engine to be able to create and support single-page browser applications, I'm not certain about the direction the project will ultimately head. I chose the placeholder name "Evo-Game," because the initial idea was that I wanted to craft an open-source engine that encouraged other developers to contribute obscure ideas that could evolve and compound on existing ideas.

The long and the short of it is simply this: it's an experiment.

### Structure

A few of the core concepts that currently exist are:

* User/Character Relations
* Inventory Building Concepts (Items, Currency, etc.)
* Character Building Concepts (Level, Class, etc.)
* Engine-Generated Content

As this projects moves forward, I'd like to maintain the core idea of building a "roguelike" engine with procedurally generated content - that is to say: items, characters, environments, etc., are created by the engine to create a unique and unpredictable gameplay experience.

### Progress

Currently "Evo-Game" is in the very early stages of development. The server-database relation is still being established and user connectivity is being implemented and basic classes have began developing into core assets for the engine (Player, NPC, Item). My intention is to ensure the foundation of the engine is solid before moving forward.
